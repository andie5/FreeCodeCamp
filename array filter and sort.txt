Waypoint: Filter Arrays with filter
The filter method is used to iterate through an array and filter out elements where a given condition is not true.
filter is passed a callback function which takes the current value (we've called that val) as an argument.

Any array element for which the callback returns true will be kept and elements that return false will be filtered out.

The following code is an example of using filter to remove array elements that are equal to five:
Note: We omit the second and third arguments since we only need the value

array = array.filter(function(val) {
  return val !== 5;
});

Use filter to remove all elements from array that are greater than 5.

Sort Arrays with sort
You can use the method sort to easily sort the values in an array alphabetically or numerically.

Unlike the previous array methods we have been looking at, sort actually alters the array in place. However, it also returns this sorted array.

sort can be passed a compare function as a callback. If no compare function is passed in it will convert the values to strings and sort alphabetically.

Here is an example of using sort with a compare function that will sort the elements from smallest to largest number:

var array = [1, 12, 21, 2];

array.sort(function(a, b) {

  return a - b;

});
