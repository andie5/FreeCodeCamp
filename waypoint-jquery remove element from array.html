Waypoint: Disable an Element Using jQuery
You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons.

When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked.

jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.

Here's how you would disable all buttons:

$("button").prop("disabled", true);

Disable only the target1 button.


Here's how you would rewrite and italicize the text of our heading:

$("h3").html("<i>jQuery Playground</i>");

jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags.

Change the button with id target4 by italicizing its text.

Waypoint: Remove an Element Using jQuery
Now let's remove an HTML element from your page using jQuery.

jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely

Remove element target4 from the page by using the .remove() function.

Manipulate Arrays With push
Not only can you pop() data off of the end of an array, you can also push() data onto the end of an array.

Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.
